# Lab 38: Cookie Stand Admin App Development
## Tasks Completed Today:
- Set up a Next.js project for the Cookie Stand Admin app.

- Created a custom <Header> component for the app's header.

- Developed the <CreateForm> component, which allows users to add new cookie stands with location and hourly sales data.

- Implemented a function to handle the creation of new cookie stands and store them in a state array.

- Designed a <Footer> component that displays the number of cookie stand locations worldwide based on the stored data.

- Worked on styling the app using Tailwind CSS utility classes.

- Created an <Overview> page to display an overview of the app.

- Added navigation links between the main page and the overview page.

- Set up an array to store data for cookie stands and used it to generate reports.

- Developed the <ReportTable> component to display reports and calculate totals per hourly slot.

## Challenges Faced:
- Initially had issues with routing and linking between pages, but resolved them by adjusting the folder structure and using correct Link components.

- Styling the components to match the provided spec required some time and experimentation with Tailwind CSS.
